# Robot-Mapping

This project contains implementation of 4 mapping techniques:
- Discrete Occupancy-Grid Mapping
- Continuous Occupancy-Grid Mapping
- Discrete Semantic Mapping
- Continuous Semantic Mapping

To see the derivations and implementation details, look at https://github.com/nalinbendapudi/Robot-Mapping/blob/master/report.pdf

## Usage Instructions

In MATLAB, enter the command: `run(mapping_type, true)'. Here `mapping_type' is either 1,2,3,or 4 according to the order in which they are mentioned above

## Results

The following plots show the map generated by each of the techniques
